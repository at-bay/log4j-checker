### Description
`log4j-checker` tool helps identify whether a certain system is running a vulnerable version of the log4j library. Download and run the tool on each suspected system in your organization. Please refer to the usage section for more details.
This cli tool will try to locate java processes that are using a vulnerable version of log4j library and provide an indication if found.

This project is made for non-commercial and ethical testing purposes only, and is offered as-is, without warranty.

### Prerequisites
#### Java
The log4j vulnerabilities are only relevant, in general, to machines running Java processes.
To know if Java runtime is installed on the machine at question, open terminal and hit (as root): `java -version`.
If no Java runtime is present, you can proceed to another machine.

#### OpenJDK
To automatically scan the system running Java processes, you would need *Open Java Development Kit (OpenJDK)* that packs the `jps` command-line tool, to be available on your `$PATH`. If you don't want to or can't install OpenJDK on your system, you can still run the checker tool in manual mode as [described below](#Usage).

To find out if `jps` is present on your system, simply issue the command `jps -h` on the target machine's terminal.
If `jps` is installed you would be returned with something similar to:
```shell
usage: jps [--help]
       jps [-q] [-mlvV] [<hostid>]
...
```
This means you can proceed to the [installation](#Installation) section below and skip the OpenJDK installation step straight to [downloading](#MyHeading) the `log4j-checker`.

### Installation
#### Download & Extract OpenJDK
If `jps` is not installed that means that OpenJDK is not available on your `$PATH`, and you would need to download OpenJDK.

The below instructions *do not* install OpenJDK (as there is no need for actual installation), but download and extract a prepared OpenJDK binary and use it for the sole use of the `log4j-checker` tool. Feel free to delete the downloaded and extracted OpenJDK directory when you're done.
```shell
# for other versions and more instructions checkout: https://adoptopenjdk.net/installation.html
wget -L https://github.com/adoptium/temurin16-binaries/releases/download/jdk-16.0.2%2B7/OpenJDK16U-jdk_x64_linux_hotspot_16.0.2_7.tar.gz -O OpenJDK16U-jdk_x64_linux_hotspot_16.0.2_7.tar.gz
tar xzf OpenJDK16U-jdk_x64_linux_hotspot_16.0.2_7.tar.gz
export PATH=$PWD/jdk-16.0.2+7/bin:$PATH
```
#### <a id="MyHeading"></a> Download Latest `log4j-checker`
```shell
wget -L https://github.com/at-bay/log4j-checker/releases/download/v1.0.8/log4j-checker-linux-amd64-v1.0.8.bin -O log4j-checker-linux-amd64-v1.0.8.bin
chmod +x log4j-checker-linux-amd64-v1.0.8.bin
```

### Usage
To scan *all* running Java processes on the current machine, we recommend running the tool with root permissions:
```
Usage of sudo ./log4j-scanner-amd64-darwin-v1.0.8.bin:
  -exclude value
        path to exclude. example: -exclude PATH [-exclude ANOTHER]
  -ignore-v1
        ignore log4j 1.x versions checks
  -include value
        path to include. example: -include PATH [-include ANOTHER]
  -log string
        log file to write output to
  -verbose
        verbose output. without this flag, no output unless vulnerable
```
