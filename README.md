### Prerequisites
To automatically scan all running Java processes, you would need an installation of [jps](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/unix/jps.html).
First verify your Java version (from cmd: `java -version`) and install the appropriate JDK using:
```
# on Debian/Ubuntu systems
sudo apt install openjdk-VERSION-jdk-headless
```
Alternatively, specify (multiple pairs of) `--include PATH` argument to scan specific directories but not the currently running Java processes
